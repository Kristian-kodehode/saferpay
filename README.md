# Saferpay - a secure online payment provider

Saferpay is a subproject of one of my other projects; React Userflow Ecommerce.
I wanted that project to be totally fictional yet believable so in the payment section
i added a fictional company called SaferPay, i made the logo and called it a day, but it kinda stuck in my head.
So fast forward a few weeks and i decided to at least create a landing page for the SaferPay company, and this is it.

It does not have many functions and it is more about the design aspect and also to just give some more depth to my other project which uses SaferPay. I will probably use SaferPay as my go-to payment for my fictional project just to be able to use it over and over instead of using something real-world inside a case-study like the project i mentioned.

Overall this project was superfun to make since i do like a consistent and strict design. I like the seriousness, yet playfullness behind it. It is serious enough to let you think they are a capable and trustworthy company, yet they are welcoming and caring for their customers. That was my goal and i think i achieved it.

It will probably recieve some updates here and there as i feel like it.
